# 📊 Statistics Lab Work – README

## 🧾 Overview

This repository consists of **six Jupyter Notebooks (Lab Work 1.1 to 1.6)** that serve as a practical foundation for learning key statistical concepts. Each notebook covers specific topics such as types of data, data visualization, central tendency, dispersion, correlation, and hypothesis testing. These labs are structured to provide hands-on experience using **Python** (primarily **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scipy**) to analyze and interpret real-world data.

These notebooks are designed for academic purposes, supporting coursework and practical assignments in **introductory statistics** and **data analysis**.

## 📁 Lab Files Description

### ✅ `Lab Work_1.1.ipynb` – *Introduction to Statistics and Data Types*
- **Purpose**: Introduces the basic building blocks of statistics.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Types of data: categorical vs numerical
  - Scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio
  - Structured representation of datasets
- **Outcome**: Helps understand how to categorize data correctly and prepares you for deeper analysis.

---

### ✅ `Lab Work_1.2.ipynb` – *Graphical Representation of Data*
- **Purpose**: Focuses on visualizing data for better understanding and communication.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Bar plots, pie charts, histograms
  - Boxplots and distribution curves
  - Plotting with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`
- **Outcome**: Teaches how to convert raw data into informative graphics.

---

### ✅ `Lab Work_1.3.ipynb` – *Measures of Central Tendency*
- **Purpose**: Explains how to find and interpret averages.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Mean, median, mode (manually and using functions)
  - Interpretation and comparisons of central values
- **Outcome**: Gain skills in summarizing data with representative statistics.

---

### ✅ `Lab Work_1.4.ipynb` – *Measures of Dispersion*
- **Purpose**: Goes beyond central tendency to measure data spread.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Range, variance, standard deviation
  - Quartiles and interquartile range (IQR)
  - Visual validation using boxplots
- **Outcome**: Understand data variability and consistency across values.

---

### ✅ `Lab Work_1.5.ipynb` – *Correlation and Association*
- **Purpose**: Understand relationships between variables.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Pearson and Spearman correlation
  - Covariance
  - Heatmaps and scatter plots
- **Outcome**: Learn to identify and interpret linear and non-linear relationships.

---

### ✅ `Lab Work_1.6.ipynb` – *Hypothesis Testing*
- **Purpose**: Introduces statistical inference techniques.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Null and alternative hypothesis
  - One-sample & two-sample z-tests and t-tests
  - p-value interpretation and significance levels
- **Outcome**: Gain the ability to draw conclusions from sample data.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Interactive Python environment)
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualization
  - `scipy.stats` – statistical functions
  - `random`, `math` – basic operations

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By completing all six lab notebooks, you will:

- Classify and organize data effectively
- Visualize patterns and distributions in datasets
- Compute and interpret central tendency and dispersion
- Analyze relationships through correlation techniques
- Conduct hypothesis testing to support decision-making
- Strengthen hands-on Python skills in data analysis

---

## 📌 Note:
Each lab is **self-contained** and includes both **code and explanations**, making them easy to follow even for beginners. They are intended to be run sequentially from Lab Work 1.1 to 1.6 for the best learning flow.
